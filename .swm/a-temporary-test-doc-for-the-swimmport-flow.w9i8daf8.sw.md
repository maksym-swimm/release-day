This code snippet defines a `RectangleClass` as an anonymous class assigned to a variable. The class has a constructor that takes `height` and `width` as arguments and sets them as properties of the class instance.

```
// Expression; the class is anonymous but assigned to a variable
const RectangleClass = class {
    constructor(height, width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }
};
```
